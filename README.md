#### I am a **Software Engineer** :computer: :pen: :notebook: :coffee: working at Dubai/UAE .
- I came from remote area of the world known as **KASHMIR** :sunrise_over_mountains:. 
- I want to do a space-walk, and spend some weekends in space :rocket: , its wierd but i want to do it one day.
- I have completed my masters in **Computer Applications** aka (M.C.A) from the [University of Kashmir North Campus](http://northcampus.uok.edu.in/)
- I smoke and eat **code** , i work mostly on backend technologies like **mysql**, **python**, **flask**, **docker**, **kubernetes**, **gcp**, **php**.
- I strongly believe that **The only perfect code, is the code never written**, you and your code grows with time, so why so serious.
- I dont ship code without **test-cases**, i prefer to work as a team rather then solo, as i believe that in order to do big things u need to learn to **STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF GAINTS** in your field.
- I have become fond of writing less code, and try to code based on the principle of *The Last Responsible Moment* try not to over-engineer things thinking too much about future.
- I hate working with people who like to play solo in Software team, i tend to like to share all my knowledge and skills with my team-mates inorder to grow in collabrative manner rather then indvidual selfish behaviours.
