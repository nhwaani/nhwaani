- I am a **Software Engineer** @[noon](https://noon.com).
- I came from remote area of the world known as **KASHMIR**. 
- I have completed my masters in **Computer Applications** aka (M.C.A) from the [University of Kashmir North Campus](http://northcampus.uok.edu.in/)
- I smoke and eat **code** , i work mostly on backend technologies like **mysql**, **python**, **flask**, **docker**, **kubernetes**, **gcp**, **php**.
- I strongly believe that **The perfect code is no code at all**, you code and you grow with time , and you need to embrace it .
- I dont ship code without **test-cases**, i prefer to work as a team rather then solo, as i believe that in order to do big things u need to learn to **STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF GAINTS** in your field.
- I love **api** based approach to web development, since the day i worked with them.
