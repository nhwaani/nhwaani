- I smoke and eat **code** , i work mostly on backend technologies like **mysql**, **python**, **flask**, **docker**, **kubernetes**, **gcp**, **php**.
- I strongly believe that **The only perfect code, is the code never written**, you and your code grows with time, so why so serious.
- I have become fond of writing less code, and try to code based on the principle of *The Last Responsible Moment* try not to over-engineer things thinking too much about future.
